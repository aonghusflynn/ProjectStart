The start_project gem is a simple way of downloading the latest version of your favourite framework.

It's very easy to use: simply install the gem as normal with gem install start_project and then run the command line tool ProjectStart --type {framework} --name {name of project} and it will pull the latest version of the framework and extract it to your machine with the name you provided.

Currently, there are 5 frameworks: html 5 boilerplate, bootstrap, 960 grid, 320 and up, and mass
gs960
andup320
mass, but I'll be adding more in the future.
